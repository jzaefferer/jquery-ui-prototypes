[jQuery UI](http://jqueryui.com/) - Prototypes
================================

This repository is kind of a graveyard for prototypes that were developed to become part of jQuery UI, but were abandoned. They might one day be picked up again, but for the moment we want to have a clean repository without a bunch of long-dead feature branches.

In this repository:

- [datepicker-dead](../../tree/datepicker-dead), a copy of the early history of the datepicker rewrite. The current history is [in the main repository](https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/../../tree/datepicker).
- [editable](../../tree/editable), an implementation of an [Editable](http://wiki.jqueryui.com/w/page/12137959/Editable) widget. Created during the grid project and eventually abandoned.
- [formcontrols](../../tree/formcontrols), themable replacements for the native [radio](http://wiki.jqueryui.com/w/page/12138030/Radiobutton) and [checkbox](http://wiki.jqueryui.com/w/page/12137730/Checkbox) buttons. Since native controls can still not be styled properly, this is likely to be revived.
- [grid](../../tree/grid), see [Grid](http://wiki.jqueryui.com/w/page/34246941/Grid)
- [mask and timepicker](../../tree/mask), see [Mask](http://wiki.jqueryui.com/w/page/12137996/Mask) and [Timepicker](http://wiki.jqueryui.com/w/page/12138092/Timepicker), mostly abandoned due to accessibility issues. Some alternatives have recently been presented, e.g. [politespace](https://github.com/filamentgroup/politespace)
- [menubar](../../tree/menubar), see [Menubar](http://wiki.jqueryui.com/w/page/38666403/Menubar)
- [timepicker-clearempty](../../tree/timepicker-clearempty), some additions to the timepicker implementation in the mask branch
